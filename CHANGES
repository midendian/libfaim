------------------
 - Fri Dec 24 21:30:06 UTC 1999
   - Added an error-counting Read() that has been sitting in my inbox
   - Cleaned up header files, created aim_cbtypes.h.

 - Fri Dec 24 11:12:34 UTC 1999
   - Cleaned up both outgoing and incoming ICBM handling.  Anything
       that crashes around there is no longer libfaims fault!
       - The encoding flags are now passed up to the client.
   - Added several TLV routines to parse large blocks of continuous
       TLV triplets.  Not terribly effecient, but quite elegent in usage.
   - Added icbm_setparams() back in from way-back-long-ago.  It hasn't
       been implemented in a long time, but I think we should still send it.

 - Fri Dec 24 01:23:06 UTC 1999
   - Fixed a very minor bug in aim_newconn().
   - Added aimutil_get{16,32}()
   - Added aim_extractuserinfo() for extracting  user data
       blocks and putting them into struct aim_userinfo_s's.
         - Added a loop to print out info on extraneous TLVs.
         - Put in lots of comments.
   - Added parse_oncoming_middle() to parse the user data
       block of that packet.  Now passes struct aim_userinfo_s
       to client.
   - Rearranged parse_userinfo_middle().  Now passes an entire
       userinfo struct to client instead of individual variables.
   - Convered the version of parse_im_middle() thats actually getting
       used to pass up a userinfo struct.  
   - Updated faimtest to accept new structs.

 - Tue Dec 21 06:18:50 UTC 1999
   - Fixed a Win32 header problem
 - Tue Dec 21 03:44:13 UTC 1999
   - Latency timers now update on rx as well as tx.  Gets rid of even more
       of the rate problems that most clients are having.  
   - Renamed lasttx and settxlatency to lastactivity and setlatency, respec.
   - Integrated fixes needed for Win32 -- should compile cleanly now (DMP)
   - Cleaned up some places, use aim_putsnac everywhere now.

 - Sun Sep 26 20:04:20 MST 1999
   - Reduced the IM parsing to look for 3 zeros instead of 4 -- NEEDS WORK
       - This was needed to work with MacAIM3 and some WinAIM3s.
   - Added aim_conn_settxlatency() for throttling outgoing frames -- NEEDS WORK
   - Added an int to the userinfo and incoming IM user callbacks for new
       TLV that AOL put it in -- its the number of seconds elapsed since
       the user logged in
   - Worked more on the callbacks (more internal rearrangements)
   - Fixed bug in aim_select() (returning negative fds)
   - Clear out logininfo struct before putting more data into it
   - Other bugfixes that I can't particularly remember.

 - Tue Aug 24 03:13:12 UTC 1999   --- TRANSITION RELEASE!!
   - Added jbm's new aim_rxqueue.c, which should crash less
   - Started the overhaul on the callback system.  No where near complete yet.

 - Sun Aug  1 03:02:17 UTC 1999
   - Added aimutil_*()s in aim_util.c for raw byte placement
   - Cleaned up aim_im.c, aim_auth.c, and aim_login.c using aimutil_*
   - Added AIM_IMFLAGS, flags option to aim_send_im(), removed
       aim_send_im_away()
   - Added client_info parameter to aim_send_login()
   - Tweaked aim_send_im() (AOL changed a few things, there's some more
       changes left to do)
   - Some Chat stuff changed, still no where near functional
   - Finally remembered to switch the license to LGPL (from GPL)
   - Permit/Deny (blocking) list support added
   - Released a snapshot

 - Sat Jul 31 05:28:38 UTC 1999
   - Changed aim_bos_setdeny() to aim_bos_changevisibility() and actually
       did the implementation.  

 - Fri Jul 23 17:45:22 UTC 1999
   - Work around for the AOL change in IP syntax (thanks to Eric Peyton)
   - Released snapshot

 - Sun Apr 25 23:31:44 UTC 1999
   - Fixed stupid off-by-one bug in aim_logoff()

 - Sun Apr 25 22:43:31 UTC 1999
   - Renamed/reclassified missed IM errors (now all callbacks -- no backend handling)
   - Killed aim_login() -- all connections now opened in frontend
   - aim_conn_close() will not close fd's < 3
   - Released snapshot.

 - Sat Apr 10 22:44:07 UTC 1999
   - Changed how rx_command->handled works; now uses return value from callback
   - Changed the if's in the dispatcher (aim_rxhandlers.c) to switch()es
